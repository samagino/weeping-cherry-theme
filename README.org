* Relevant Info
So this is like the greatest emacs theme ever made and if you don't
think so then umm that's fine I guess you do you sis :)

Also, this theme was originally made with [[https://github.com/mswift42/themecreator][this]], then I changed it
some.

  Wow! Look at that!

* Trees
  So trees are pretty cool and they want to be your friends
  (usually). Weeping cherry trees are a kind of tree, and by virtue of
  being a kind of tree they are pretty cool and want to be your
  friends (usually).
